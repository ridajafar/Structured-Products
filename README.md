"This repository contains a diverse set of finance-related exercises and case studies, primarily implemented in Python. The exercises cover various aspects of financial modeling and analysis. Here's an overview of the included content:

1. **Case Study: Certificate Pricing**
   - Analyze the pricing of a certificate issued by Bank XX, considering the spread over Libor (200 bps) and other terms mentioned in the annex.
   - Determine the participation coefficient in a single-curve interest rate modeling setting.
   - Incorporate market parameters for basket underlyings, correlation, dividend yields, and discounts.

2. **Exercise: Pricing Digital Option**
   - Compare the pricing of a digital option using the Black model with and without considering the smile in the implied volatility curve.
   - Utilize provided dataset and specify relevant option details.

3. **Exercise: Pricing**
   - Compute call prices according to a normal mean-variance mixture model with specific parameters.
   - Implement pricing using various methods, including FFT, Quadrature, and Monte Carlo, for a range of moneyness values.
   - Optionally, consider an α=1/3 model and compare results obtained with FFT and Quadrature methods.

4. **Case Study: Volatility Surface Calibration**
   - Perform the calibration of a normal mean-variance mixture model with α=1/3 parameters, focusing on the SP 500 volatility surface.
   - Plot implied volatility obtained from the model and compare it with market-implied volatility.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for financial practitioners and enthusiasts interested in exploring and practicing different financial modeling techniques and calibration methods."
